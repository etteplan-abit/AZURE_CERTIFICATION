# Exercise Paths

## Overview
Exercises and projects to practice AI engineering skills.

## Useful Links
[Get started with Azure AI Foundry projects in VS Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/vscode) contains information about using the VS Code container image in Azure AI Foundry portal.

[Azure AI Foundry SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/sdk-overview)
enables you to write code to connect to Azure AI Foundry projects and access resource connections, which you can then work with using service-specific SDKs.

[AI Services SDKs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/reference/sdk-package-resources) AI service-specific libraries for multiple programming languages and frameworks that enable you to consume Azure AI Services resources in your subscription.

[Azure AI Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview), which is accessed through the Azure AI Foundry SDK and can be integrated with frameworks like [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started) and [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview) to build comprehensive AI agent solutions.

[Prompt Flow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html) SDK, which you can use to implement orchestration logic to manage prompt interactions with generative AI models.

## Tips

1. When planning to use the VS Code container image in Azure AI Foundry, consider the cost of the compute required to host it and the quota you have available.
